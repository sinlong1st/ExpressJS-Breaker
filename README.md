Including:
+ Server setup
+ Routing, routers
+ Data transfering

Set up:
+ Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
+ Init the source by terminal: npm init -y
+ Install Express by terminal with syntax: npm i express
+ Install nodemon: npm i --save-dev nodemon (For someone might not know, nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected)
+ In package.json, put this in the "scripts" object: "devStart": "nodemon server.js" (server.js is the Server file we are coding on, change it depends on your server file name)
+ npm run devStart => run all the code in the server.js and when ever you modify the file, it would automatically reload it => save lots of time
+ npm i ejs => a view engine we use for this mini project. (make sure to install ejs language in your IDE so it can understand the ejs syntax: <% %>)
=> All set
